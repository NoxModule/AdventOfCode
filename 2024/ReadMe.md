## Running a Solution
1. Compile the solution using `ghc`. Example below shows how to compile the first solution.
    ```shell
    ghc -outputdir ./target -o ./target/01.exe 01.hs
    ```
1. Run the solution's binary. Example below shows how to run the first solution.
    ```shell
    ./target/01.exe
    ```
